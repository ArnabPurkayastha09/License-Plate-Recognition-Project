# License Plate Recognition Project

This project implements a vehicle detection and license plate recognition system using YOLOv8 and EasyOCR. It processes video files to detect vehicles, extract license plates, and apply optical character recognition (OCR) to read the plate numbers. The detected license plates are then overlaid on the video frames with bounding boxes around both the vehicles and their corresponding plates.

## Features

- Vehicle detection using YOLOv8
- License plate extraction and recognition with EasyOCR
- Visualization of detected license plates with bounding boxes
- Interpolation of missing data to smooth output

## Future Enhancements

To improve the accuracy of the extracted text from EasyOCR, future enhancements will focus on refining the OCR model and exploring additional preprocessing techniques to enhance text recognition performance, particularly in challenging conditions such as varying lighting and angles.
